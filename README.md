## Introduction

Tic-Tac-Toe is a classic two-player game where the goal is to get three in a row on a 3x3 grid. This project enhances the traditional game by implementing an intelligent computer player using the Minimax algorithm, making it challenging and fun to play.

## Features

- Player vs. Computer mode with Minimax algorithm
- Player vs. Player mode
- Simple and intuitive user interface

## How to Play

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.
3. Compile and run the program.
